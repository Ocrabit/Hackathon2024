# Belmont Transportation Hackathon
### Description
A hackathon I did in April of 2024 where we focus on trying to find solutions to a transportation issue in Nashville TN. My role was to create interactive maps using coordinate data of bus stops and different amenities like what bus stops had benches. I also used a converting library to get the zipcodes for each bus stop based on the coordinate location. This allowed us to look at each stop in regards to its demographic data.
